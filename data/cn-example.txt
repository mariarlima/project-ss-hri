 The boy is taking a cookie out of the cookie jar and he has one in his left hand to reach down to give to his sister. Well, he has it in his left hand. His sister or girl is reaching up for a cookie and has her index finger or her right hand pointed upward close to her mouth. She's saying shh because they're going to have to be quiet because the stool is going to fall over. The boy has his right heel on his left toe. He's wearing running shoes with pom poms on them. The socks look pretty sloppy. I observed that one of the two slippers that the girl is wearing looks as if its sole is thicker than the one, the left one is thicker than the right. The woman is letting the sink run over. The water is running full tilt and overflowing the sink. She's drying a plate and she has a towel in her right hand and looks as if she has something else. No, that's the curtain at the back, the end of the curtain that's behind her, the plate in her left hand. She has her left side to the window. She's already dried a plate and two cups. The window is open and you can see the path outside going around the back of the house and another room in the house, the window is also open, I believe. The woman is standing with her foot in the water. The water isn't running, in other words, but it's splashing up and the right shoe is in the water, cuddle. And that's what I see in the kitchen.
