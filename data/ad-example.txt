 And there's the picture. All the action that you can see. The little boy climbing up in some cookies at the cookie jar. And it lets sister reach in for some. And the little boy standing on a ladder. And it makes sister watching the dishes. At the sink. Big sister watching the dishes. She got dishes on the sink. I think she's running water. Can you tell me anything else that's going on over there? And I say that little sister's reaching. Johnny, he's up on the ladder getting some cookies. Little sister reaching up after her. He's passing down to her. Okay, anything else? And the ladder about to turn over. Okay. Anything else going on over here? The cups. Maybe she doesn't watch them, but she's sitting on the sink. And maybe running water on the sink. And she's got a crazy pool. She might get some light in there. Some dishes stacked up. They might be on the sink. Anything else? Nothing at all. Okay, good.
